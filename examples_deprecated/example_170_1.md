# Description
Generate all simple paths in the graph `G` from source to target, starting from shortest ones. Demonstrates the usage of `shortest_simple_paths` and computing k shortest/best paths between two nodes.

# Code
```
import networkx as nx

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(7)
    >>> paths = list(nx.shortest_simple_paths(G, 0, 3))
    >>> print(paths)
    [[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 6, 5, 4, 3]]

    You can use this function to efficiently compute the k shortest/best
    paths between two nodes.

    >>> from itertools import islice
    >>> def k_shortest_paths(G, source, target, k, weight=None):
    ...     return list(islice(nx.shortest_simple_paths(G, source, target,
    ...         weight=weight), k))
    >>> for path in k_shortest_paths(G, 0, 3, 2):
    ...     print(path)
    [0, 1, 2, 3]

```
